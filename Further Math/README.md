# Some facts that are useful

1. Proof of Induction steps: Base case n = ?, Assume true for n = k, Prove true for n = k + 1, Conclusion
2. Proof of Induction Conclusion: If n=k true, then n=k+1 true. As true for [Base case], true for all n>=[Base case]
3. Proof of Induction topical types: Series, Matrices, Divisibility, Sequences
4. Vector angles are measured anticlockwise, Complex number angles can have negatives (so for positive go anticlockwise if starting from 1st quadrant, else negative clockwise for 4th quadrant - cannot get angles more than 180 or less than -180)
5. Polar curves as (r, Î¸), compared to cartesian (x, y)
6. Matrices are kind of like a collection of vectors
