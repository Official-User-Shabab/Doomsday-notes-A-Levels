#### Forced (Syria-Germany)

    Cause: Civil War (since 2011) leading to widespread violence, humanitarian crisis (lack of basic needs), & political instability/oppression.
    
    Character: Forced/Refugee Migration driven by survival, perilous journeys (Distress Migration), involving vulnerable populations (women, children, elderly).
    
    Scale:
    Out-migration (Syria): über 6.8 M refugees globally (UNHCR, 2023).
    In-migration (Germany): Peak in 2015-2016, with Syrians being the largest group. 280,000 asylum applications by Syrians in 2016. über 800,000 Syrian refugees in Germany by 2023.
    
    Pattern: Initial movement to neighboring countries (Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan), then secondary movement to Europe (Germany, Sweden, Austria) using irregular routes. Concentration in urban areas in Germany.
    
    Impact:
    Origin (Syria): über 15% population loss, significant reduction in working-age population, GDP contracted by 60-70%, loss of skilled workers.
    Destination (Germany): Slight increase in population growth rate. über 26% of the population with a migration background by 2020. Significant initial costs for social welfare & housing, but potential for long-term positive fiscal impacts with ~50% employment/vocational training rate by 2020 for 2015 arrivals. Varying public opinion & integration challenges.

#### Free (Mexico-USA)

    Cause: 
    Economic Disparities (wage differences, job opportunities in USA), US labor demand (agriculture, construction, services), Social Networks in the USA, & Political/Economic Instability in Mexico (poverty, lack of opportunities).
    
    Character: 
    Voluntary/Economic Migration, often Circular Migration, significant Family Reunification.
    Large portion is Irregular Migration due to limited legal pathways.
    2007-present: 40.9% Mexicans in skilled jobs
    1900-1941: 61.4% in agriculture, <10% in skilled/professional
    2017: 86% Mexican immigrants be 18-64 y/o
    
    Scale:
    Large-Scale Flow: 2023: ~10.9 M Mexican immigrants in USA, largest foreign-born group (around 23%). Peaked 2010 = 11.7 M
    Significant Diaspora: 
    Concentrated in California (36%) & Texas (22%), also significant in Illinois (6%) & Arizona (5%). 
    Major cities include Los Angeles (14%), Chicago (6%), Houston, Dallas, Riverside (around 5% each).
    
    Pattern: 
    Historically concentrated in border states (CA, TX, AZ, NM), but increasingly dispersed across USA (FL, WA, GA, NV, NC, NY). 
    Rural to Urban Movement within the US.
    
    Impact:
    Origin (Mexico): Significant Remittances (record $64.7 B in 2024, 96.6% from USA, ~4.5% of GDP), average transaction ~$393. Social Costs (family separation), potential brain drain, but also reduced unemployment.
    Destination (USA): Economic Benefits (filling labor shortages, e.g., >70% of CA farmworkers undocumented, ~5% of US workforce), complex Fiscal Impacts (initial costs vs. long-term contributions), increased Social & Cultural Diversity but also social tensions & debates about assimilation (estimated 5.1 M undocumented Mexicans in 2022), major Political Impacts (immigration policy, elections).
