### Divergent Continental-Continental Rift Valley

### Divergent Continental-Oceanic Ridge

### Convergent Oceanic-Oceanic Island Arc

### Convergent Continental-Oceanic Fold Mountain



### Freeze thaw & frost shatterin (physical)

Occurs when water in joints freezes at 0 degrees C

Fluctuation around freezing point

It expands by about 9% & exerts pa up to max 2100 kgcm^-2 at 22 degrees C

These pa greatly exceed most rocks resistance

### Salt crystalisation (physical)

H20 evap leaving salt crystals behind

Temp++ ∴ salt expand

In areas with Temp≈26//28 C, Na & NaCO3 expand by 300%

∴ pa on joints, ∴ forced to crack

### Pressure release (physical)

### Thermal expansion & contraction (physical)

### Wetting & drying (physical)

### Veggie root action (physical)

### Hydration (chemical)

### Hydrolysis (chemical)

### Carbonation (chemical)

### Organic weathering via chelation (chemical)
