## Tewkesbury 2007 floods

Costs & Impacts of flood:
- 13 died
- 7 K businesses flooded
- 27 K household insurance claims
- 414.1mm x̄ raingall across England & Wales
- Sewage überflow & contaminated waterways
- Vegetation loss ∵ uprooted
- £3 B überall cost to insurers
- 350 K people in Gloucestershire had ! H2O supply
- 140 K people w/! H2O for 1 week

Causes of flood: 
- Heavy Rainfall : The primary cause was prolonged & intense rainfall über June & July 2007.
- Saturated Ground : The ground was already saturated from previous rainfall, reducing its ability to absorb more water.
- River überflow : Rivers, including the Severn, burst their banks due to the excessive volume of water.
- Urbanization : Increased impermeable surfaces in urban areas led to higher runoff & reduced infiltration.

Random data:
- 2022: Welsh gov. promised £3b M in flood defenses
- Gov. promised to spend £5.2 B über 5 years to fund flood defenses

## River Severn

Drainage basin size (River Severn) = 4,409 square miles

Length = 220 miles

    
  ### The Upper course
    
    The source of the River Severn is on the slopes of the Plynlimon Hills, 610m a.s.l.
    
    Here in the welsh hills, annual rainfall > 2500mm & run off = high, ∵the steep upland slopes. 
    
    The geology = mainly hard rocks: shale (impermeable) & grit. 
    
    Near source, channel = narrow & shallow & full of angular stones, ∴friction w/ the bed & banks slow the river down. 
    
    The river mainly erodes vertically, forming V shaped valley w/ steep slopes, where processes such as soil creep & mass movement are active.
    
  ### The Middle Course
    
    Rainfall drops to below 700mm per year here. 
    
    The rocks (softer & more permeable): sandstones, conglomerates & gravel. 
    
    The river is wider & deeper.
    
    The river now erodes sideways (lateral erosion) as well as downwards, ∴valley becomes wider & flatter, creating a flood plain.
    
    Deposition occurs on the inside bends of meanders & during flooding.
    
    Sediment in the river is becoming smaller & rounded.
    
    As more tributaries join the Severn, its discharge increases.
    
  ### The Lower Course
    
    lower Severn valley.geology = mainly soft mudstone & lias cübered w/ alluvium, sand & gravel.
    
    The river channel is much wider, 70m by the time it gets to Tewkesbury.
    
    Because the channel is wide & deep there, friction-- ∴velocity at highest.
    
    Major tributaries discharge++ even more. 
    
    Lateral erosion continues to widen the river.
    
    Deposition occurs, especially at the river mouth where the flow is slowed by the sea.
