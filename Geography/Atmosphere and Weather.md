## Levels of Atmosphere:

    Exosphere
    Thermosphere
    Mesosphere
    Stratosphere
    Troposphere

## Global Energy Budget:

### Incoming radiation:

    19% is reflected off cloudsA
    6% is lost to scattering ( radiation diverted by gas molecules)
    17% of this is absorbed by the gases in the atmosphere such as CO2 and ozone.
    4% of this is absorbed by clouds
    7% is reflected by the earth’s surface (called albedo)
    So only 47% actually reaches the earth’s surface to be absorbed

### Outgoing radiation:    

    8% of re-radiated energy is lost to space
    Evaporation & condensation account for a loss of 25 % of heat energy von earth ∵heat energy is used up when liquid turned into vapour (latent heat transfer)
    7% of this re-radiated energy is absorbed by clouds, water vapour and CO2

## Daytime Energy Budget:

    L = Long wave radiation
    L = Latent Heat (Evaporation)
    S = Sensible Heat Transfer
    I = Insolation
    R = Reflected Solar Radiation
    S = Surface Absorption

## Nighttime Energy Budget:    

    L = Long wave radiation
    L = Latent Heat (Condensation)
    S = Sensible Heat Transfer
    S = Subsurface Supply

Mist occur when 1000m < visibility < 5000m      Fog occur when visibility < 1000m

## Advection Fog: 

    As warm, moist air pass horizontally over cold surface, 
    it is chilled,
    & condensation takes place ∵air.temp--
    ∴reaches dew (saturation) point

## Radiation Fog: 

    Occur in low lying areas 
    when ground surface heat-- at night
    by long wave radiation 
    ∴air immediately above it is cooled
    ∴condensation and fog

## Temperature Inversion:

    During day, ground heated by sun’s λ-- radiation,
    after short time, it heats air above it when it emits long wave radiation.
    At night, ground surface and air, heat energy-- absorbed during the day. 
    \\the ground heat energy-- faster als air 
      ∵it is efficient++ conductor of heat. 
    By the end of night, ground surface cold very, & air directly above it will be cooled too
      ∵close proximity to the surface.
    \\air layer above this, will be warm++ 
      ∵it has cooled at a rate-- als ground surface
    ∴temperature inversion.

The North Hemisphere has much more land so there is a lot of seasonal change, whereas the South Hemisphere has a lot of water, so little seasonal change occurs. 

## Variations in temperature and winds:

### Angle of the overhead sun, latitude and thickness of atmosphere: 
    Lower
    latitudes (equatorial regions) have higher temperatures than higher latitudes
    (Poles) this is as a result of the amount of heating that each area receives. Places
    near the equator receive direct heat on a small surface area, and experience little
    energy loss via absorption, scattering and reflection, as there is a relatively small
    amount of atmosphere to pass through. Towards the Poles, the surface area to be
    heated increases, as does the amount of atmosphere to pass through, increasing
    losses via, absorption, scattering, and reflection.
  
  
  Height above sea level: 
  
    It is important to remember that the atmosphere is heated
    from ground level upwards via long-wave radiation. The higher up a mountain
    you go, the smaller the surface area available to heat the atmosphere above. This,
    in combination with a decrease in the ability of the air to retain heat results in
    lower temperatures.
    
Distance from land and sea: 

    Land and sea have vastly different specific heat
    capacities (the amount of energy needed to raise 1kg of a substance by 1 degree).
    They have different abilities to absorb, transfer and radiate heat energy. Generally,
    land surfaces respond to heating on a daily basis (diurnal) meaning that
    differences between day and night temperatures can be into double figures, but
    sea surfaces respond over a period of months and retain heat for longer. The sea
    heats up and cools down more slowly than the land, acting to moderate
    temperatures for coastal locations.
