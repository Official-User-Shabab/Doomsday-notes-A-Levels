## 1.1 Drainage Basin System

### Global Water Stores

#### Water Stores 
    
    Oceans
    Polar ice & Glaciers
    Ground water (aquifers)
    Lakes
    Soils
    Atmosphere
    Rivers
    Biosphere
    

### Hydrological cycle

  #### Stores {
  
    Interception
    Soil Water
    Surface water
    Groundwater storage
    Channel
  }

#### Flows {

  Above ground {
  
    Throughfall
    Stemflow
    Overland
    Channel
  }
  
  Below ground {
  
    Infiltration
    Percolation
    Throughflow
    Groundwater flow
    Baseflow
  }
}

Outputs {
  Evaporation
  EVT
  River discharge
}
