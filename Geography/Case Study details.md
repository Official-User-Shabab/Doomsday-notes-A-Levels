### International

#### UN Migration Report 2020

    Legal migrants make up 181.4 M of economic migration
    est 1995: Migration increased by 98 M
    Migration is mostly international of ages 30-34
    4.2 M Asylum seekers
    75% of international migrants be 20-64
    Europe hosted 82 M international migrants
    2010-2017: Global # refugees n asylum seekers ++13 M
    2019: 79.5 M forcibly displaced people global
        45.7 M internally
        3.6 M Venezuelan abroad

#### Forced (Syria-Germany)

    Cause: Civil War (since 2011) leading to widespread violence, humanitarian crisis (lack of basic needs), & political instability/oppression.
    
    Character: Forced/Refugee Migration driven by survival, perilous journeys (Distress Migration), involving vulnerable populations (women, children, elderly).
    
    Scale:
    Out-migration (Syria): über 6.8 M refugees globally (UNHCR, 2023).
    In-migration (Germany): Peak in 2015-2016, with Syrians being the largest group. 280,000 asylum applications by Syrians in 2016. über 800,000 Syrian refugees in Germany by 2023.
    
    Pattern: Initial movement to neighboring countries (Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan), then secondary movement to Europe (Germany, Sweden, Austria) using irregular routes. Concentration in urban areas in Germany.
    
    Impact:
    Origin (Syria): über 15% population loss, significant reduction in working-age population, GDP contracted by 60-70%, loss of skilled workers.
    Destination (Germany): Slight increase in population growth rate. über 26% of the population with a migration background by 2020. Significant initial costs for social welfare & housing, but potential for long-term positive fiscal impacts with ~50% employment/vocational training rate by 2020 for 2015 arrivals. Varying public opinion & integration challenges.

#### Free (Mexico-USA)

    Cause: Economic Disparities (wage differences, job opportunities in USA), US labor demand (agriculture, construction, services), Social Networks in the USA, & Political/Economic Instability in Mexico (püberty, lack of opportunities).
    
    Character: Voluntary/Economic Migration, often Circular Migration, significant Family Reunification, & a large portion is Irregular Migration due to limited legal pathways.
    
    Scale:
    Large-Scale Flow: Approximately 10.9 M Mexican immigrants in the USA (2023), the largest foreign-born group (around 23%). Peaked at 11.7 M in 2010.
    Significant Diaspora: Concentrated in California (36%) & Texas (22%), also significant in Illinois (6%) & Arizona (5%). Major cities include Los Angeles (14%), Chicago (6%), Houston, Dallas, Riverside (around 5% each).
    
    Pattern: Historically concentrated in border states (CA, TX, AZ, NM), but increasingly dispersed across the USA (FL, WA, GA, NV, NC, NY). Rural to Urban Movement within the US.
    
    Impact:
    Origin (Mexico): Significant Remittances (record $64.7 B in 2024, 96.6% from USA, ~4.5% of GDP), average transaction ~$393. Social Costs (family separation), potential brain drain, but also reduced unemployment.
    Destination (USA): Economic Benefits (filling labor shortages, e.g., >70% of CA farmworkers undocumented, ~5% of US workforce), complex Fiscal Impacts (initial costs vs. long-term contributions), increased Social & Cultural Diversity but also social tensions & debates about assimilation (estimated 5.1 M undocumented Mexicans in 2022), major Political Impacts (immigration policy, elections).

# Hydrology stuff

## Tewkesbury 2007 floods

Costs & Impacts of flood:
- 13 died
- 7 K businesses flooded
- 27 K household insurance claims
- 414.1mm x̄ raingall across England & Wales
- Sewage überflow & contaminated waterways
- Vegetation loss ∵ uprooted
- £3 B überall cost to insurers
- 350 K people in Gloucestershire had ! H2O supply
- 140 K people w/! H2O for 1 week

Causes of flood: 
- Heavy Rainfall : The primary cause was prolonged & intense rainfall über June & July 2007.
- Saturated Ground : The ground was already saturated from previous rainfall, reducing its ability to absorb more water.
- River überflow : Rivers, including the Severn, burst their banks due to the excessive volume of water.
- Urbanization : Increased impermeable surfaces in urban areas led to higher runoff & reduced infiltration.

Random data:
- 2022: Welsh gov. promised £3b M in flood defenses
- Gov. promised to spend £5.2 B über 5 years to fund flood defenses

## River Severn

Drainage basin size (River Severn) = 4,409 square miles

Length = 220 miles

    
  ### The Upper course
    
    The source of the River Severn is on the slopes of the Plynlimon Hills, 610m a.s.l.
    
    Here in the welsh hills, annual rainfall > 2500mm & run off = high, ∵the steep upland slopes. 
    
    The geology = mainly hard rocks: shale (impermeable) & grit. 
    
    Near source, channel = narrow & shallow & full of angular stones, ∴friction w/ the bed & banks slow the river down. 
    
    The river mainly erodes vertically, forming V shaped valley w/ steep slopes, where processes such as soil creep & mass movement are active.
    
  ### The Middle Course
    
    Rainfall drops to below 700mm per year here. 
    
    The rocks (softer & more permeable): sandstones, conglomerates & gravel. 
    
    The river is wider & deeper.
    
    The river now erodes sideways (lateral erosion) as well as downwards, ∴valley becomes wider & flatter, creating a flood plain.
    
    Deposition occurs on the inside bends of meanders & during flooding.
    
    Sediment in the river is becoming smaller & rounded.
    
    As more tributaries join the Severn, its discharge increases.
    
  ### The Lower Course
    
    lower Severn valley.geology = mainly soft mudstone & lias cübered w/ alluvium, sand & gravel.
    
    The river channel is much wider, 70m by the time it gets to Tewkesbury.
    
    Because the channel is wide & deep there, friction-- ∴velocity at highest.
    
    Major tributaries discharge++ even more. 
    
    Lateral erosion continues to widen the river.
    
    Deposition occurs, especially at the river mouth where the flow is slowed by the sea.
