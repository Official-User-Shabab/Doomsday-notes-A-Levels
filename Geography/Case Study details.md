# Tewkesbury 2007 floods ∴ ∵

Costs & Impacts of flood:
- 13 died
- 7 K businesses flooded
- 27 K household insurance claims
- 414.1mm x̄ raingall across England & Wales
- Sewage overflow & contaminated waterways
- Vegetation loss ∵ uprooted
- £3 B overall cost to insurers
- 350 K people in Gloucestershire had ! H2O supply
- 140 K people w/! H2O for 1 week

Causes of flood: 
- Heavy Rainfall : The primary cause was prolonged and intense rainfall over June and July 2007.
- Saturated Ground : The ground was already saturated from previous rainfall, reducing its ability to absorb more water.
- River Overflow : Rivers, including the Severn, burst their banks due to the excessive volume of water.
- Urbanization : Increased impermeable surfaces in urban areas led to higher runoff and reduced infiltration.

Random data:
- 2022: Welsh gov. promised £3b M in flood defenses
- Gov. promised to spend £5.2 B over 5 years to fund flood defenses

## River Severn

Drainage basin size (River Severn) = 4,409 square miles

Length = 220 miles

    
  ### The Upper course
    
    The source of the River Severn is on the slopes of the Plynlimon Hills, 610m a.s.l.
    
    Here in the welsh hills, annual rainfall > 2500mm & run off = high, ∵the steep upland slopes. 
    
    The geology = mainly hard rocks: shale (impermeable) & grit. 
    
    Near source, channel = narrow & shallow & full of angular stones, ∴friction with the bed and banks slow the river down. 
    
    The river mainly erodes vertically, forming V shaped valley w/ steep slopes, where processes such as soil creep and mass movement are active.
    
  ### The Middle Course
    
    Rainfall drops to below 700mm per year here. 
    
    The rocks (softer and more permeable): sandstones, conglomerates & gravel. 
    
    The river is wider and deeper.
    
    The river now erodes sideways (lateral erosion) as well as downwards, ∴valley becomes wider and flatter, creating a flood plain.
    
    Deposition occurs on the inside bends of meanders and during flooding.
    
    Sediment in the river is becoming smaller and rounded.
    
    As more tributaries join the Severn, its discharge increases.
    
  ### The Lower Course
    
    lower Severn valley.geology = mainly soft mudstone and lias covered with alluvium, sand and gravel.
    
    The river channel is much wider, 70m by the time it gets to Tewkesbury.
    
    Because the channel is wide and deep there, friction-- ∴velocity at highest.
    
    Major tributaries discharge++ even more. 
    
    Lateral erosion continues to widen the river.
    
    Deposition occurs, especially at the river mouth where the flow is slowed by the sea.

# Migration stuff

## UN Migration Report 2020

    Legal migrants make up 181.4 M of economic migration
    Migration increased by 98 M est 1995
    Migration is mostly international of ages 30-34
    4.2 M Asylum seekers

## China

    1980: x.urban.pop = 170 M von Σ∀ = 970 M
    2020: x.urban.pop = 850 M von Σ∀ = 1.4 B
    SEZ Programme 1980
    1980: x.trade.worth w/ USA = $5 B
    2020: x.trade.worth w/ USA = $665 B
