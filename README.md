# Doomsday-notes-A-Levels

Here are some notes and also resources (found probably on the Internet) that have been used for study. They have helped in revision for A-Level exams.

Even if you can't read the actual content (possibly due to little messy handwriting) you can still hopefully take inspiration on how to structure your notes.

DISCLAIMER:

These notes/resources may contain mistakes
By using these notes/resources, I cannot accept any blame for questions you get wrong because of these notes/resources
Some things may be written in a way that only makes sense to me.
